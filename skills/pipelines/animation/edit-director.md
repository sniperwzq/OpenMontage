# Edit Director - Animation Pipeline

## When To Use

This stage turns the scene plan into an animatic-grade edit plan. Timing is the product.

## Prerequisites

| Layer | Resource | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Schema | `schemas/artifacts/edit_decisions.schema.json` | Artifact validation |
| Prior artifacts | `state.artifacts["assets"]["asset_manifest"]`, `state.artifacts["scene_plan"]["scene_plan"]`, `state.artifacts["script"]["script"]` | Assets, timing plan, and beats |
| Playbook | Active style playbook | Motion and typography rules |

## Process

### 1. Protect Hold Time

After key reveals, plan enough time for the viewer to process the frame. Do not stack every scene edge to edge with motion.

### 2. Stagger Secondary Elements

Primary element first, supporting elements second. The edit decisions should reinforce hierarchy.

### 3. Keep Motion Meaningful

Motion should signal:

- emphasis,
- transition,
- transformation,
- contrast.

### 4. Use Metadata For Timing Detail

Recommended metadata keys:

- `hold_windows`
- `stagger_rules`
- `transition_map`
- `scene_timing_notes`

### 5. Prefer Phrase Subtitles

For narration-led animation or comic recap videos, default subtitles to phrase/page captions, not word-by-word or karaoke highlighting. Word-level timestamps may still be used internally to group short caption pages, but the rendered subtitle style should be plain phrase display unless the user explicitly asks for active-word highlighting.

Recommended subtitle fields:

- `style`: `"phrase"`
- `max_words_per_line`: 4-7 for vertical video
- `position`: `"bottom-center"`
- `captionHighlightMode`: `"none"` when building Remotion props

### 6. Quality Gate

- key information has enough dwell time,
- movement clarifies hierarchy,
- transitions stay consistent,
- the edit remains readable on the target platform.

## Common Pitfalls

- Overcrowding the timeline with continuous motion.
- Revealing all elements at once.
- Letting stylistic motion reduce readability.
